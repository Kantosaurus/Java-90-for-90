# Project 36: Chatbot

## Description
A simple rule-based chatbot that can engage in basic conversations with users. The chatbot can recognize greetings, farewells, and respond to various questions and statements. It uses pattern matching and predefined responses to simulate natural conversation.

## Java Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections Framework (HashMap)
- String Manipulation
- Regular Expressions
- Random Number Generation
- Input/Output Handling
- Control Flow

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac Chatbot.java ChatbotApp.java
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   java ChatbotApp
   ```

## Features
- Natural language processing for basic conversation
- Recognition of greetings and farewells
- Predefined responses to common questions
- Random response variation for greetings and farewells
- Pattern matching for user input
- Simple and intuitive console interface

## Example Usage
1. Run the program
2. Type your message and press Enter
3. The chatbot will respond based on your input
4. Try different types of messages:
   - Greetings (hello, hi, hey)
   - Questions (what is your name, what can you do)
   - Statements (thank you, help)
   - Farewells (bye, goodbye)
5. Type 'exit' to end the conversation

## Notes
- This is a simplified version of a chatbot
- The chatbot uses basic pattern matching and predefined responses
- Future improvements could include:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Machine Learning integration
  - Context awareness
  - More sophisticated response generation
  - Multiple conversation topics
  - User profile management
  - Conversation history
  - API integration for real-time information
