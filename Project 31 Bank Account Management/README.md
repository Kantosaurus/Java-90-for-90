# Project 31: Bank Account Management System

## Description
A simple console-based bank account management system that allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts in Java, including classes, objects, encapsulation, and user input handling.

## Java Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- User Input Handling
- Exception Handling
- Static Variables
- Control Flow

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac BankAccount.java BankManagementSystem.java
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   java BankManagementSystem
   ```

## Features
- Create new bank accounts with unique account numbers
- Deposit money into accounts
- Withdraw money from accounts (with balance checking)
- Check account balance
- Input validation for all operations

## Example Usage
1. Run the program
2. Choose option 1 to create a new account
3. Enter your name when prompted
4. Use options 2-4 to perform banking operations
5. Choose option 5 to exit the program

## Notes
- This is a simplified version of a bank management system
- Account data is not persisted between program runs
- The system currently supports only one active account at a time
- Future improvements could include:
  - Multiple account support
  - Data persistence
  - Transaction history
  - Interest calculation
  - Account types (Savings, Checking, etc.)
